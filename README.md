## Robot simulation

Robot simulation is an application that allows to control multiple robots
on a board plotted in GNUPlot. You can add robots, obstacles and detect collision
betweenn them.
This project was made on univesity class to learn about OOP and OOD. New
graphic objects are made in `Fabryka` class which uses two design patterns:
singleton and factory.
